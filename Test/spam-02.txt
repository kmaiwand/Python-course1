Kal,

Best restaurant in the U.S. that I have ever tried:
   Asia de Cuba (on Madison Avenue, between 37th and 38th, in the Hotel Morgans)

   No sign on the door (glass door)
   Reserve many weeks in advance, or if you can be patient with 1 martini,
   caipirina or two, then go on a waiting list (~1 hour on Saturdays) on the
   same night

Decent Hotel:
   Hotel Pennsylvania (401 7th Avenue, across Madison Square Garden and Penn
   Station, walking distance from Time Square)
   ~$100-$130 on week-ends.
   Tel. 212-736-5000
   Very clean and secure, rooms kind of old, but nothing to complain about

Have fun!

Stephane
